        <h1>How We Started</h1>
        <p>Heading back to more than a decade ago, there were really few shops which used to sell branded musical instruments.<br>
            The idea for Guitar Shop originated in 2008 with the aim to provide musical instruments of quality brands to the Nepali <br>
            community at a reasonable price and the first outlet of Guitar Shop was opened in Ason.
            Guitar Shop now has a total of 8<br>
             outlets all over Nepal and houses some of the leading music-instrument brands. Guitar Shop is more than just a guitar store <br>
             where we offer the largest selection of popular guitars, amplifiers, keyboards, drums, percussion, microphones, <br>
             studio gear and more for your musical journey no matter your musical taste.</p>
